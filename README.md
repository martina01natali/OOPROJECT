# OOPROJECT
Exam project for Object Oriented Programming course.

The main goal of the exam was to produce two projects, in Python and C++, to analyze experimental data from tests on amplifiers and SiPMs.


Organization:
- pyproj is the project in Python and Jupyter Notebooks
- cproj is the project in C++
- subprojects are named "/branch_\*"
- final codes are in folders named "/Def" 
- TEST_\* files are codes to test analysis routines on the classes that have been written, so you should always start from there
- "/Data" folders contain experimental data on which to run your code. !!IMPORTANT!! Most heavy loads of data have been gitignored, since they were very heavy, so you should contact me if you need those.

Full explanation of everything that's going on is not assured. I tried my best but I am aware that I may have missed some important things.
